# K-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm

This is my implementation of my KNN algorithm

To test it, I used it as an image classifier on the MNIST dataset.
It resulted with a 93% success rate using the first 1000 images as a testing set.

note: The images in the MNIST dataset get more convoluted the farther into the data
you go so this test only used the 'cleanest' data
